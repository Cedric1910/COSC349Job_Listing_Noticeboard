# Job Listing Noticeboard

COSC349 Assignment 1
Developed by Hugo Baird, Cedric Stephani

This application aims to give users a platform to post available job positions using a form which then gets displayed on the noticeboard where job-seekers can find work in a simple and reliable way. This is separated into three virtual machines, each contributing functionality through a particular component. 

- First virtual machine: Server which hosts the Job listing form

- Second virtual machine: MySQL database

- Third virtual machine: Server which hosts the Job listing noticeboard
